мое объявление:

#крипто_халява #крипто_канал
"ЕНОТ"
Я разрабатываю платформу для пруфа сигналов и оценки новостей  -  https://yeenot.today
идея в том чтобы создать комьюнити, которое оценивает сигналы, а также привлечь инсайдеров и владельцев новостных каналов чтобы публиковали новости, которые будет оценивать комьюнити.
Сейчас вот как раз на этапе создания сообщества. Но чувствую что с таким объемом фейков в теме крипты - это очень нужная вещь и проект станет популярен.
Так что если хотите быть инсайдером - велком. Регайтесь, создавайте канал, публикуйте сигналы. Будем оценивать и голосовать.
Если вы трейдер, заходите, смотрите сигналы, оценивайте. Все сигналы-новости имеют рейтинг зависящий от голосований и изменения цены монеты.
Канал может конечно и своих ребят туда привлечь, особенно если он не фейковый, он будет заинтересован в дополнительной оценке своих сигналов как реальных.
Вот как то так. Назвал его енотом, потому что YES/NOT

Подробнее см. в правилах на сайте https://yeenot.today/catalog/rules/
В планах - интеграция с телеграмом, создание топ каналов, топ лидеров мнения и многое многое другое. Пишите в личку @satrum (https://t.me/satrum) или группу проекта свои предложения по усовершенствованию.
наши контакты:
email support@yeenot.today
channel https://t.me/yeenot_today
group https://t.me/yeenot_chat
blog https://medium.com/@yeenottoday

Там все просто:
1. Регаетесь
2. На любой новости голосуете - оценивая влияния и достоверности новостей (с учетом направления)
3. Через некоторое время в профиле видно сколько очков набрали и другая статистика
4. Можете добавить свою новость, смотрите на другие новости и действуйте по аналогии. Она будет не только на сайте, так что от качетсва текста и картинки тоже многое зависит.
5. Можете создать свой канал, это делается в профиле кнопка под Sources
6. После создания канала, мы аппрувим его и при публикации новостей вы сможете его указывать как свой Source (источник, какнал)


Скоро будет страница канала, топ каналов, топ лидеров мнения.
Чем больше аудиторию мы привлечем, тем более точный будет прогноз и главное - более оперативный.

"ЕНОТ"
https://yeenot.today
Платформа для проверки криптосигналов и оценки влияния и достоверности новостей 
Инсайдеры и владельцы каналов могут публиковать сигналы, которые оценивает сообщество и голосует.
Трейдеры смотрять сигналы и новости и оценивают их, для получения очков.
Все сигналы-новости имеют рейтинг зависящий от голосований и изменения цены монеты.
Подробнее см. в правилах на сайте https://yeenot.today/catalog/rules/
В планах:
Интеграция с телеграмом и социльными сетями
Топ Каналов
Топ Лидеров мнения
Airdrop YEENOT очков пользователей ресурса как ERC20 токенов

Регистрируйтесь, голосуйте, добавляйте сигналы для проверки.

Пишите в группу проекта свои предложения по усовершенствованию.
Очень поможете если есть информация где можно искать заинтересованную аудиторию.

"Golem Deep Dive - excellent work and vision from developers. From rendering to machine learning vefirication."
added for voting and forecast on YEENOT TODAY https://yeenot.today/catalog/news/189
summary:
summary:
There is much more to Golem than verification of broadly defined nondeterministic tasks, but this seems to be one of the most prominent challenges in a decentralized and trustless setting
A detailed introduction to Monte Carlo rendering was presented to give you a better understanding of the problems one has to tackle when fully a decentralized infrastructure is to be prepared. As most of the issues are well known, applying them in a trustless decentralized setting requires additional thoughts in order to balance: quality, security, pricing, and efficiency
Our approach to this challenge was presented and we shared a few ideas and directions we’re already exploring in regard to improving general network security without sacrificing too much efficiency
A few approaches to verification of rendering tasks were shown along with the introduction of Concents, optional infrastructural component purposed with securing the network and allowing software developers to implement custom licensing logic
Then Intel SGX technology was shown as a potentially good fit with regard to both nondeterministic verification and decentralization of Concent

close contact with the AFM (Authority Financial Markets) and DNB (The Dutch Central Bank) to anticipate any changes related to the upcoming regulations.
ARK shares our vision of making blockchain and thereby cryptocurrencies accessible for everyone.
ARK is working on ACES, which is a community project that is creating cross-chain operability protocols. This means that you will be able to transfer value across different blockchains. 
The ACES project could provide us with the ability to react to transactions on a variety of blockchains by exposing an API that allows us to efficiently listen to (transaction) events. 
Although Blockport is based in Amsterdam, cryptocurrencies are cross-border and so are we. This means that we first start with focusing on the European market since there is less competition and the European market needs a proper Euro-to-crypto exchange.
Also, we are most familiar with the regulatory environment in Europe. After we have established ourselves in the European market, we will be targeting other parts of the world as well. We have a lot of people from the U.S. and Asia in our community, and we see a huge demand coming from those parts of the world as well.

Recommendation:
Monero
In our opinion, Monero is the clear choice amongst the privacy coins if you are looking for something that is fully private, fungible, and decentralized.
All of the other coins have some aspect that falls short of what Monero offers and can potentially put your privacy and security at risk. 
One thing to note is that, due to Monero’s comprehensive privacy protocol, there is a real possibility of governments looking to find a way to crack down on the coin.
Its potential for use within illegal activity has attracted significant attention from the likes of the U.S. Government, so hedging your bet in this space with a pseudo-private alternative such as ZCash, Zcoin, or PIVX could be a good long-term strategy within the privacy sub-asset class. 
Privacy coins have been a hot topic to start 2018, and we see them being major players in the ecosystem going forward. As always, we remind you that everyone should conduct their own due diligence whenever they invest in a crypto asset.

Nanomate - service for sending NANO with all mesaging apps. 

NanoMate is designed to help Nano adoption by making it easy and effective to introduce your friends to Nano by sending them a small amount.
When you create an escrow address, you'll immediately be given a 'secret redeem link', that you can send to the recipient however you like. Any Nano you send to the generated address can be unlocked by anyone with the secret redeem link.
An interesting side-effect of this new feature is that the recipient can now be undefined.
You can verify this on YEENOT TODAY 
time to rise for NANO ?
